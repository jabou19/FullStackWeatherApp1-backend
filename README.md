# WeatherAppFullStack
Backend (Spring MVC) 
## How should the application be run?
 (a Fullstack ) All the 3 parts of the application ie. database, backend and frontend must be started 
separately, and it must be done in the following order.
1. Database: MySQL is set up via Docker. So therefore, man must start by having the docker app 
up and running, and then man must run docker-compose.
2. The backend is made in Spring Boot and must be started by pressing the start button, which 
can be found under the com/weather/service folder and then under the WeatherApplication
 class.
3. Finally, the frontend must be started up. React is used for the front end and it can be started by 
running "npm start" in the terminal.
4. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
