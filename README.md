## How should the application be run?
 (a Fullstack ) All the 3 parts of the application ie. database, backend and frontend must be started 
separately, and it must be done in the following order.
1. Database: MySQL is set up via Docker. So therefore, man must start by having the docker app 
up and running, and then man must run docker-compose.

### `docker-compose up -d`

3. The backend is made in Spring Boot and must be started by pressing the start button, which 
can be found under the BackendSpring/src/main/java/com/weather/WeatherApplication.java class.
4. Finally, the frontend must be started up. React is used for the front end and it can be started by 
running "npm start" in the terminal.
